## What is Peer prep ðŸ“•
Peer prep is aw web application that helps students find tutors in their local university. Students sign in and find tutors available. This app was made for two reasons:
1. To help students in their academic journey. When you don't quite get the concept of what the lecturer is talking about about, you can hop on the app and find students who have overcome your struggles to help you conquer your problems.
2. To test my coding skills, and my problem solving capacity. This app opened doors to what I can possibly do with my knowledge. While developing this app I learnt a lot, and it thought me to go about solving problems that even Stackoverflow couldn't help with.

## The tech stack I used ðŸ”¥:
I am mostly a Java head so my focus will be Java. I would've loved to use Vanilla Java however, I just wanted to get something out there so, tech stack:
- Javalin for backend
- MySQL for database management
- DaisyUI for styling
- Flyway for database migration
- JUNIT for testing
